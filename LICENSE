Modified by Rich Geldreich 4/26/18- fixed bugs in detexBlock128ExtractBits() and FullyDecodeEndpoints(),
compared vs. DirectXTex'c BC7 decoder for correctness.

 * rg: Removed external dependencies, remarked out HDR support because
 * we don't need it, minor fix to decompress() so it converts non-sRGB
 * output to 8-bits correctly. I've compared this decoder's output
 * vs. astc-codec with random inputs on 4x4 blocks, and after fixing a few obvious
 * bugs in astc-codec where it didn't correctly follow the spec they match so
 * I'm assuming they are both correct for 4x4 now.
 * HDR support should be easily added back in, but as we don't need it
 * I'm leaving this for someone else.
